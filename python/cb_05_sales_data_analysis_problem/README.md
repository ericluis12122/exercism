# Sales Data Analysis Problem

Imagine you are part of an e-commerce company with detailed sales records. Each sale is represented as a dictionary containing the **product name, sale date, sale amount, and buyer's location**. Your task is to perform an advanced analysis of these sales.

## Requirements:

1. **Filter** sales made in the **last quarter** of the year.
2. **Select** only sales where the amount is **greater than $500**.
3. **Group** sales by the **buyer's location**.
4. **Calculate** the **average sale amount** for each location.
5. **Sort** locations in **descending order** based on the average sale amount.

Use **lambda functions** for efficient data processing.

## Example:

### ðŸ“Œ Input:
A sales record (JSON, dictionary, etc.).

### ðŸ“Œ Expected Output:
Locations ranked by average sales amount, e.g., **["Chile", "Ecuador"]**.

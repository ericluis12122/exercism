# Inventory Management

Imagine you work at a logistics company, and your task is to develop an inventory management system. The inventory is represented as a list of products sorted by their codes. Each product is described as a dictionary with the keys `code` and `quantity`.

Your objective is to implement a recursive function that performs a binary search on this inventory and returns the available quantity for a specific product, given its code.

## Example Input and Output

| Input                                           | Output |
|------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Inventory of products (JSON, dictionary, etc.) |        |
| Product code being searched                   |        |
| Available quantity for product `307`         | `80`   |
